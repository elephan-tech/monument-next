              the students move to through their daily class schedule.

              Students have daily academic blocks with a maximum of a 1:15 adult
              to student ratio, focusing on Literacy and Humanities, Math, and
              Science. Between these blocks, students have a social lunch,
              recess, and opportunities for electives such as PE, Health,
              Performing Arts, Instrumental Music and Spanish. Classroom
              instruction is targeted to meet student needs and is designed to
              provide all students with choice, movement, and authentic learning
              experiences.

              After the academic day, students engage in enrichment activities

              their reading homework and have time to relax with evening family
              activities like community meetings, board games, or movie night.
              We provide a warm, home-like environment in the boarding program
              while embedding studentsâ€™ acquisition of important independent
              living skills.

              Early Sunday evening, students are dropped off and families have a
              chance to speak with staff. The same opportunity exists on Friday
              afternoon when students are picked up for the weekend. The purpose
              of a structured drop-off and pick-up is to establish and develop
              relationships with caregivers and to keep lines of communication
              open to ensure a seamless transition between home and school life.
