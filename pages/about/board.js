                you….look out the window and dream child, prepare to become who

              Neela has worked in public education in the District of Columbia
              for over a decade, including eight years at the District of
              Columbia Public Schools (DCPS) in a variety of roles. As Deputy
              Chief of Special Education Compliance, she managed DCPS’ response
              to four major federal lawsuits and monitoring by state and federal
              government. DCPS has since exited three out of four lawsuits,
              including two that were nearly two decades old. She was also the
              Chief of Staff in the Office of General Counsel, Deputy Chief of
              Central Office Effectiveness in the Office of Human Capital and a
              member of the Chancellor’s critical response team. Additionally,
              she served as the Assistant Superintendent of Operations in the
              Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE), the state
              education agency of D.C., overseeing grants management, dispute
              resolution, enrollment and residency support, building operations
              and procurement planning. Neela is currently an independent
              consultant. She has a J.D. from the University of Virginia School
              of Law and a B.A. in government from the College of William and
              Mary. She lives in Washington, D.C. with her husband and two
              daughters.

              What Excites You About Monument Academy
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" color="">
              Monument Academy serves children in a fundamentally different way
              than a traditional school. I’m excited about the school’s focus on
              meeting students where they are, operating a weekday boarding
              program, filling their lives with supportive adults who believe in
              their potential, and focusing on the needs of the entire family so
              that each student can achieve greatness.

              Favorite Teacher
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" color="">
              I’ve been blessed to have many important teachers in my life, my
              parents being the most important of all. My high school history
              teacher, Ms. Wood, is the person I credit with challenging my
              world view and daring me to dream. She taught me the importance
              and power of a single person believing in you, which is what I
              hope that each student at Monument Academy feels in their time at
              the school.
